# Given a sorted array arr with possibly some duplicates, the task is to find the first and last occurrences of an element x in the given array.
# Note: If the number x is not found in the array then return both the indices as -1.

# Examples:

# Input: arr[] = [1, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 67, 123, 125], x = 5
# Output: [2, 5]
# Explanation: First occurrence of 5 is at index 2 and last occurrence of 5 is at index 5
# Input: arr[] = [1, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 123, 125], x = 7
# Output: [6, 6]
# Explanation: First and last occurrence of 7 is at index 6
# Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3], x = 4
# Output: [-1, -1]
# Explanation: No occurrence of 4 in the array, so, output is [-1, -1]


def find( arr, x):
        
        # code here
    start, end = 0, len(arr)-1
    
    ans_left, ans_right = -1,-1
    #search left
    while start<=end:
        mid = (start+end)//2
        if arr[mid]==x:
            ans_left =mid
            end = mid-1
        if arr[mid]<x:
            start = mid+1
        if arr[mid]>x:
            end = mid-1
    start, end = 0, len(arr)-1
    #search right
    while start<=end:
        mid = (start+end)//2
        if arr[mid]==x:
            ans_right =mid
            start = mid+1
        if arr[mid]<x:
            start = mid+1
        if arr[mid]>x:
            end = mid-1
    return [ans_left, ans_right]

arr = [1, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 67, 123, 125]
x = 5

print(find(arr,x))


#method - binary search - first search left and then right
